functionality added:
    BASIC
    1.) letter tiles are selected randomly and added to the users hand. this
        does not use the proper distribution.
    2.) once letters are placed they cannot be moved.
    3.) the program keeps track of which tile is placed on which scrabble square.
    4.) the board has bonus squares and they are used in calculating the Score
    5.) the score is tallied correctly.

    ADDITIONAL
    6.) the player can go until all tiles are used, there is a bug where the
        last tiles do not "leave" the board.
    7.) the board is cleared after each round.
    8.) after each hand, only enough tiles to fill the users hand up to 7 tiles
        are added.
    9.) score is kept until the end of the game.
    10.) tiles are only able to be dragged to the board, if dragged elsewhere
         they are returned to the holder.
    11.) once placed on the board, tiles cannot be moved.
    12.) tiles can be placed anywhere, I did not add functionality to only allow
         pieces to be placed adjacent to previously placed tiles.
